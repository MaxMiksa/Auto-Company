# Market Sizing Analysis

Comprehensive market sizing methodologies for calculating Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) for startup opportunities.

## Overview

Market sizing provides the foundation for startup strategy, fundraising, and business planning. Calculate market opportunity using three complementary methodologies: top-down (industry reports), bottom-up (customer segment calculations), and value theory (willingness to pay).

## Core Concepts

### The Three-Tier Market Framework

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**

- Total revenue opportunity if achieving 100% market share
- Defines the universe of potential customers
- Used for long-term vision and market validation
- Example: All email marketing software revenue globally

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**

- Portion of TAM targetable with current product/service
- Accounts for geographic, segment, or capability constraints
- Represents realistic addressable opportunity
- Example: AI-powered email marketing for e-commerce in North America

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**

- Realistic market share achievable in 3-5 years
- Accounts for competition, resources, and market dynamics
- Used for financial projections and fundraising
- Example: 2-5% of SAM based on competitive landscape

### When to Use Each Methodology

**Top-Down Analysis**

- Use when established market research exists
- Best for mature, well-defined markets
- Validates market existence and growth
- Starts with industry reports and narrows down

**Bottom-Up Analysis**

- Use when targeting specific customer segments
- Best for new or niche markets
- Most credible for investors
- Builds from customer data and pricing

**Value Theory**

- Use when creating new market categories
- Best for disruptive innovations
- Estimates based on value creation
- Calculates willingness to pay for problem solution

## Three-Methodology Framework

### Methodology 1: Top-Down Analysis

Start with total market size and narrow to addressable segments.

**Process:**

1. Identify total market category from research reports
2. Apply geographic filters (target regions)
3. Apply segment filters (target industries/customers)
4. Calculate competitive positioning adjustments

**Formula:**

```
TAM = Total Market Category Size
SAM = TAM × Geographic % × Segment %
SOM = SAM × Realistic Capture Rate (2-5%)
```

**When to use:** Established markets with available research (e.g., SaaS, fintech, e-commerce)

**Strengths:** Quick, uses credible data, validates market existence

**Limitations:** May overestimate for new categories, less granular

### Methodology 2: Bottom-Up Analysis

Build market size from customer segment calculations.

**Process:**

1. Define target customer segments
2. Estimate number of potential customers per segment
3. Determine average revenue per customer
4. Calculate realistic penetration rates

**Formula:**

```
TAM = Σ (Segment Size × Annual Revenue per Customer)
SAM = TAM × (Segments You Can Serve / Total Segments)
SOM = SAM × Realistic Penetration Rate (Year 3-5)
```

**When to use:** B2B, niche markets, specific customer segments

**Strengths:** Most credible for investors, granular, defensible

**Limitations:** Requires detailed customer research, time-intensive

### Methodology 3: Value Theory

Calculate based on value created and willingness to pay.

**Process:**

1. Identify problem being solved
2. Quantify current cost of problem (time, money, inefficiency)
3. Calculate value of solution (savings, gains, efficiency)
4. Estimate willingness to pay (typically 10-30% of value)
5. Multiply by addressable customer base

**Formula:**

```
Value per Customer = Problem Cost × % Solved by Solution
Price per Customer = Value × Willingness to Pay % (10-30%)
TAM = Total Potential Customers × Price per Customer
SAM = TAM × % Meeting Buy Criteria
SOM = SAM × Realistic Adoption Rate
```

**When to use:** New categories, disruptive innovations, unclear existing markets

**Strengths:** Shows value creation, works for new markets

**Limitations:** Requires assumptions, harder to validate

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define the Market

Clearly specify what market is being measured.

**Questions to answer:**

- What problem is being solved?
- Who are the target customers?
- What's the product/service category?
- What's the geographic scope?
- What's the time horizon?

**Example:**

- Problem: E-commerce companies struggle with email marketing automation
- Customers: E-commerce stores with >$1M annual revenue
- Category: AI-powered email marketing software
- Geography: North America initially, global expansion
- Horizon: 3-5 year opportunity

### Step 2: Gather Data Sources

Identify credible data for calculations.

**Top-Down Sources:**

- Industry research reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Government statistics (Census, BLS, trade associations)
- Public company filings and earnings
- Market research firms (Statista, CB Insights, PitchBook)

**Bottom-Up Sources:**

- Customer interviews and surveys
- Sales data and CRM records
- Industry databases (LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, Crunchbase)
- Competitive intelligence
- Academic research

**Value Theory Sources:**

- Customer problem quantification
- Time/cost studies
- ROI case studies
- Pricing research and willingness-to-pay surveys

### Step 3: Calculate TAM

Apply chosen methodology to determine total market.

**For Top-Down:**

1. Find total category size from research
2. Document data source and year
3. Apply growth rate if needed
4. Validate with multiple sources

**For Bottom-Up:**

1. Count total potential customers
2. Calculate average annual revenue per customer
3. Multiply to get TAM
4. Break down by segment

**For Value Theory:**

1. Quantify total addressable customer base
2. Calculate value per customer
3. Estimate pricing based on value
4. Multiply for TAM

### Step 4: Calculate SAM

Narrow TAM to serviceable addressable market.

**Apply Filters:**

- Geographic constraints (regions you can serve)
- Product limitations (features you currently have)
- Customer requirements (size, industry, use case)
- Distribution channel access
- Regulatory or compliance restrictions

**Formula:**

```
SAM = TAM × (% matching all filters)
```

**Example:**

- TAM: $10B global email marketing
- Geographic filter: 40% (North America)
- Product filter: 30% (e-commerce focus)
- Feature filter: 60% (need AI capabilities)
- SAM = $10B × 0.40 × 0.30 × 0.60 = $720M

### Step 5: Calculate SOM

Determine realistic obtainable market share.

**Consider:**

- Current market share of competitors
- Typical market share for new entrants (2-5%)
- Resources available (funding, team, time)
- Go-to-market effectiveness
- Competitive advantages
- Time to achieve (3-5 years typically)

**Conservative Approach:**

```
SOM (Year 3) = SAM × 2%
SOM (Year 5) = SAM × 5%
```

**Example:**

- SAM: $720M
- Year 3 SOM: $720M × 2% = $14.4M
- Year 5 SOM: $720M × 5% = $36M

### Step 6: Validate and Triangulate

Cross-check using multiple methods.

**Validation Techniques:**

1. Compare top-down and bottom-up results (should be within 30%)
2. Check against public company revenues in space
3. Validate customer count assumptions
4. Sense-check pricing assumptions
5. Review with industry experts
6. Compare to similar market categories

**Red Flags:**

- TAM that's too small (< $1B for VC-backed startups)
- TAM that's too large (unsupported by data)
- SOM that's too aggressive (> 10% in 5 years for new entrant)
- Inconsistency between methodologies (> 50% difference)

## Industry-Specific Considerations
