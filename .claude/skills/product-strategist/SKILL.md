SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
├── Portion of TAM we can serve with our product
├── Filter by geography, segment, use case
└── Example: 2M businesses in our target segment = $2B

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
├── Realistic market share in 3-5 years
├── Based on competition, resources, go-to-market
└── Example: 5% of SAM = $100M
