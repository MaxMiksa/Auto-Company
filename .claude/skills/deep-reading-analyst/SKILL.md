## Step 1: Initialize Analysis

**Ask User (conversationally):**
1. "What's your main goal for reading this?"
   - Problem-solving / Learning / Writing / Decision-making / Curiosity
2. "How deep do you want to go?"
   - Quick (15min) / Standard (30min) / Deep (60min) / Research (120min+)
3. "Any specific frameworks you'd like to use?"
   - Suggest based on content type (see Framework Selection Guide below)

**Default if no response:** Level 2 (Standard mode) with auto-selected frameworks

### Framework Selection Guide

Based on content type, auto-suggest:
